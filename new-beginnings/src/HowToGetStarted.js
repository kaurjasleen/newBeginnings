<b>Phase 3: Design</b> In a collaborative space, begin by building the structure of your project. This phase is critical, as it allows the next phase to be way easier.<br/><br/>

<b>Phase 4: Develop </b> Time to code!<br/><br/>

<b>Phase 5: Test </b> Use what you have built! Does it work the way you want to do? Is there a feature missing?  </p>
